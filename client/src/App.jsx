         <br></br>
        <p> You are invited to participate in a scientific experiment 
          conducted by researchers at University College Dublin. This information sheet 
          provides you with important details about the study. 
          
          Please take time to read it carefully. </p>
         <br></br>
         <p><strong> PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: </strong> </p>
         <p> The purpose of this experiment is to study collaboration in small online teams. </p>
         
         <br></br>
         <p><strong> PROCEDURES: </strong> </p>
         <p> During your participation, you will be asked to complete a survey 
          and take part in an online game. 
          The experiment will take approximately 10 minutes to complete. </p>
  
          <br></br>
     
         <p><strong> RISKS AND BENEFITS: </strong> </p>
         <p> There are no known risks associated with participating in this study. 
          Your participation will contribute to the advancement of scientific 
          knowledge in understanding online team collaboration. 
          Your participation in this study is paid, and the results may 
          benefit the society as a whole. </p>
  
        <br></br>
         <p><strong> CONFIDENTIALITY: </strong> </p>
         <p> Your participation in this study will remain confidential. 
          Your data will be de-identified, and no personally identifiable
           information will be associated with your responses. Data will be stored 
           securely and accessible only to the research team. </p>
  
          <br></br>
         <p><strong> HOW WILL MY INFORMATION BE USED? </strong> </p>
         <p> Apart from the chat texts, the only information we will have is your 
          platform-assigned payment ID (e.g. Prolific worker ID) and the timestamps of 
          your interactions with our site. We will record this ID to allow us 
          to observe participation across sessions. There is no way for us to identify you or 
          contact you outside of the crowdsourcing platform through which you joined. Anonymous data 
          may be shared publicly. Our aggregate results may be presented at scientific meetings
           or published in scientific journals. </p>
